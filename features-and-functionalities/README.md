# Backend Features & Functionalities ‚Äî Airbnb Clone

## üìö Introduction to Project Requirements
Backend development involves creating the server-side logic, database management, and API integrations that power a web application. This document focuses on the backend requirements for the Airbnb Clone project, emphasizing key features that make the app functional, user-friendly, and efficient.

The requirements below are categorized into **Core Functionalities**, **Technical Requirements**, and **Non-Functional Requirements**.

---

## üîë Core Functionalities

### 1. User Management
**User Registration**
- Allow users to sign up as guests or hosts.
- Use secure authentication methods (JWT).

**User Login & Authentication**

**Edit / Delete Listings**
- Hosts update or remove listings.

---

### 3. Search & Filtering
- Search by location, price range, number of guests, amenities (Wi-Fi, pool, pet-friendly).
- Pagination for large result sets.
- Sorting (price, rating, distance).

---

### 4. Booking Management
**Booking Creation**
- Guests book properties for specified dates.
- Prevent double bookings via availability checks.

**Booking Cancellation**

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements

### 1. Database Management

- Main tables: users, properties, bookings, payments, reviews, messages, audits/logs.

### 2. API Development
- RESTful API with proper methods & status codes.
- Optional: GraphQL for complex queries.
- API versioning and docs (Swagger / OpenAPI).

### 3. Authentication & Authorization
- JWT sessions.
- Role-Based Access Control (guest, host, admin).

### 4. File Storage
- Store images in AWS S3 / Cloudinary (or local storage for dev).

### 5. Third-Party Services
- Email: SendGrid / Mailgun.
- Payment: Stripe / PayPal / local gateways.

### 6. Error Handling & Logging
- Global error handling middleware.
- Centralized logging (e.g., Winston, Logstash) and structured logs.

---

## üöÄ Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Scalability
- Modular services, horizontal scaling via load balancers (NGINX / cloud LB).

### 2. Security
- Hash & salt passwords (bcrypt).
- Secure sensitive data and APIs (HTTPS, token expiry).
- Rate limiting, input validation, and sanitization.

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Caching (Redis) for hot endpoints (search, property lists).
- DB query optimization and pagination.

### 4. Testing
- Unit and integration tests (pytest, Jest, or similar).
- Automated API tests and CI pipeline.

## üóÇ Diagram (Draw.io)
A visual diagram should include:
- Major backend modules: Auth, Users, Properties, Bookings, Payments, Reviews, Notifications, Admin.
- Data storage: Relational DB, Object Storage (images), Redis (cache), Message queue (optional).
- External integrations: Payment Gateway, Email Provider, OAuth Providers.
- Arrows showing flows: user ‚Üí auth ‚Üí bookings ‚Üí payment ‚Üí notifications ‚Üí DB.

Save the diagram as `airbnb_backend_features.png` and place it in this directory.
